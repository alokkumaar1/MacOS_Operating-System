# 🖥️ macOS Clone – Interactive Browser-Based Desktop Environment

A fully functional, frontend-only clone of the macOS desktop experience, built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project replicates the macOS interface with working app windows, taskbar (dock), drag-and-drop, responsive design, and real-time interactions—**all inside the browser**.

> 🎯 Inspired by real desktop environments, this clone demonstrates system-level behavior entirely in frontend code, without any backend dependencies.
